  <h5 class="ion-text-center header">Terms & Conditions</h5>
  <p>
    By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
    therefore that you
    read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the
    app, or our
    trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
    shouldn’t try
    to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade
    marks,
    copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to MyData
    Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
    MyData Taiwan is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason,
    we reserve
    the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
    never charge
    you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
  </p>
  <p>
    The LIFEBOX app won’t store and process any personal data,all the data will store locally in your device.
    It’s your
    responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should be aware that there are certain things that MyData Taiwan will not take responsibility for.
    Certain functions
    of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
    provided by your
    mobile network provider, but MyData Taiwan cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
    functionality if
    you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
    with your
    mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the
    cost of data
    for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,
    you’re
    accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of
    your home
    territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
    device on
    which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
    payer for
    using the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along the same lines, MyData Taiwan cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
    need to make
    sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
    Service, MyData
    Taiwan cannot accept responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    With respect to MyData Taiwan’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
    important to
    bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on
    third
    parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. MyData Taiwan accepts no
    liability for any
    loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the
    requirements for
    both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
    and you’ll
    need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. MyData Taiwan does not promise that it will
    always
    update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have
    installed on your
    device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also
    wish to stop
    providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
    Unless we tell
    you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b)
    you must
    stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
